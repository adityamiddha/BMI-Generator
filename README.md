## 📝 Notes on BMI

While BMI is a useful tool for most adults, it does have limitations:

- It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others with muscular builds
- It may underestimate body fat in older persons or those who have lost muscle mass
- It doesn't account for factors like body composition, bone density, or fat distribution

Always consult with healthcare professionals for a comprehensive health assessment.
